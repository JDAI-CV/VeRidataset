# 1. VeRi dataset
(Please click [**here**](http://vehiclereid.github.io/VeRidataset/) to the new webpage.)

To facilitate the research of vehicle re-identification (Re-Id), we build a large-scale benchmark dateset for vehicle Re-Id in the real-world urban surveillance scenario, named "VeRi". The featured properties of VeRi include:
* It contains over 50,000 images of 776 vehicles captured by 20 cameras covering an 1.0 km^2 area in 24 hours, which makes the dataset scalable enough for vehicle Re-Id and other related research. 
* The images are captured in a real-world unconstrained surveillance scene and labeled with varied attributes, e.g. BBoxes, types, colors, and brands. So complicated models can be learnt and evaluated for vehicle Re-Id.
* Each vehicle is captured by 2 ∼ 18 cameras in different viewpoints, illuminations, resolutions, and occlusions, which provides high recurrence rate for vehicle Re-Id in practical surveillance environment.
* It is also labeled with sufficient license plates and spatiotemporal information, such as the BBoxes of plates, plate strings, the timestamps of vehicles, and the distances between neighbouring cameras.

# 4. Example codes
Here we give an example code for vehicle search evaluation.

In this code, we should first get the distance matrix of all query images and test images.
As in the example code, we have three distance matrixes obtained with SIFT-BOW, CN-BOW, CNN features seperately.
Then these matrixes are summed with different weights to obtain the final "dist" matrix.

Then we read the ground truth and junk image index (the test images that have the same camera ID with the query image, they are not considered when computing the AP) from the gt_image.txt and jk_image.txt.

After that, for each query, we rank the distance to each test image and compute the Average Presicion using the compute_AP function.
At last, we can obtain the mAP, HIT@1, HIT@5, and the CMC curves.

The model and distance files can be downloaded from [BaiduPan](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1gYBNQI0_MZLB0ANW8qnYGw) and [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0o1ZxGs_oVZWmtFdXpqTGl3WUU).
